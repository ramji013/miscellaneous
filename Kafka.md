Communication between single producing and consumer system is easy but challenges come when there are multiple producer and multiple consumer system. in the way of
1. how the data can be communicated, i.e. http, tcp, jdbc, etc...
2. data format (csv, xl, .txt, .json, etc..)


Apache kafka decouple between data stream. The target system will get the data directly from kafka.
